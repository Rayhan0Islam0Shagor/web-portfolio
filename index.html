        <p>
          You can also call me a product designer, experience designer,
          interaction, UI, UX or by any other market defined function-title. I
          prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do
          interesting things that matter. My abundant energy fuels me in the
          pursuit of many interests, hobbies, areas of study and artistic
          endeavors. Iâ€™m a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle
          different projects and roles with relative ease.
