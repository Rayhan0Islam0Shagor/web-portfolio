          You can also call me a product designer. I prefer to keep learning,
          continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter. My
          abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies,
          areas of study and artistic endeavors. I’m a fast learner, able to
          pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles with
          relative ease.

          I can be as involved in your project as you need me to be; from the
          seed of the idea, to sketches, creative direction, design,
          copywriting, system design, and even the front-end and WordPress
          build.
